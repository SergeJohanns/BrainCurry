# Script overview
This folder holds scripts that give an idea of the BrainCurry language. In principle these can be scripts of any kind, but the idea is to underline where BrainCurry differs from regular Brainfuck and how that affects the code. These scripts will be properly commented and indented to allow for explanation on how the lambdas influence the code. Regular Brainfuck code will also be explained, but this is not the main focus.

Currently this folder contains the following scripts:
- Fibbonacci
- Truth Machine

Minimised forms of these scripts are in the *Minimised* folder. The script used to minimise them is also present.
